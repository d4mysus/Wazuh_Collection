# Wazuh Collection

## Overview
This repository is used by me as I configure Wazuh. It is a constant work in progress, and I will keep adding new decoders, rules, and configurations as needed. The goal is to enhance log parsing, threat detection, and security monitoring capabilities.

## Contents
This repository contains:
- **Decoders (`decoders/`)**: Custom XML-based Wazuh decoders for parsing various log sources.
- **Rules (`rules/`)**: Custom detection rules to generate alerts based on specific log patterns.
- **Configurations (`configs/`)**: Additional Wazuh configuration files.

More items may be added over time as I refine and expand my Wazuh setup.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome! If you have additional rules, decoders, or improvements, feel free to submit a pull request.
