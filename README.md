# Wazuh Collection

## Overview
This repository is used by me as I configure Wazuh. It is a constant work in progress, and I will keep adding new decoders, rules, configurations, integrations, and tools as needed. The goal is to enhance log parsing, threat detection, and security monitoring capabilities.

## Contents
This repository contains:
- **How-To Guides (`how-to/`)**: Instructions and guides on integrating Wazuh with different tools and services.
- **Integrations (`integrations/`)**: Custom scripts and configurations to integrate Wazuh with other security and logging solutions.
- **Tools (`tools/`)**: Utility scripts to aid in Wazuh management and log analysis.

More items may be added over time as I refine and expand my Wazuh setup.

Contributions are welcome! If you have additional rules, decoders, integrations, or tools, feel free to submit a pull request.
